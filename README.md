# cimple waypoint system
This mod is based off the [fabric example mod](https://github.com/FabricMC/fabric-example-mod)

It's the first mod I've written.

It's a command-based server-side only waypoint system.

At the moment, there is no documentation here. I will (probably (hopefully)) document at a later time.
